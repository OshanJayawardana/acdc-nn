## Description
To replicate the paper results, simply run the notebook. The usage of ACDC-NN presented in the notebook is slightly different from what one would do if it used it as a predictor. We decided to show in great detail how the method works so that the user could have a greater comprehension.

### Directories:

  -Ssym_cv.mut: contains the cross-validation sets with the mutations of Ssym divided by homology with the training sets;
  
  -pdbs: the proteins structure files mutated in Ssym;
  
  -profiles: the proteins profiles files mutated in Ssym;
  
  -weights_cv: the 10 fold cross-validation weights.

### Notebook:
ACDC_NN-reproduce_results.ipynb: notebook with all the code necessary to replicate the results.
